### Hello There! My name is Ross, I'm a consistently developing developer and QA Engineer interested in all thing "TEST".

#### I'm currently working on building my skills and understanding of various testing functionality with Java, Junit and Maven and am in the process of taking on-board new testing tools to push my skills further.

#### I'm also very fond of Ruby and Javascript and jump at the chance to give coding in those languages a go!

#### Away from code I enjoy learning human languages too, dancing tango and keeping fit at the gym!
